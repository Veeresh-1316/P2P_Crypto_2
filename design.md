- Based on Python
- Initializations
  - a

  - c
  - d

- Transaction class:
  - Class for storing every transaction
  - timestamp - the time of creation of the transaction
  - txid - unique transaction id of every transaction : hash of a random number, along with the timestamp
  - sender - the sender of the transaction
  - receiver - the receiver of the transaction
  - coins - number of coins being transferred from sender to receiver
  - **REPRESENTATION** - "{TxID}: {sender} pays {receiver} {coins} coins"
  - size of transaction - **1KB**

- CoinBaseTransaction:
  - Subclass of Transaction class
  - Class for storing the CoinBase transaction which is at the start of every Block
  - sender stored as NONE for easy access
  - **REPRESENTATION** - "{TxID}: {receievr} mines {coins} coins"

- Block:
  - Class for representing a block in the blockchain
  - blkid - unique block id : hash of prev_blkid, creation_time and tansations included
  - prev_blkid - the block id of the pevious block in the blockchain
  - creation_time - the time at which the block was created and published
  - transactions - list of all the transactions the block encompasses
  - miner_id - id of peer who created this block
  - size of block - **(number of transactions) * 1KB** (upto a maximum size of 1MB) (including coinbase transaction)
  
- BlockChain:
  - Class which stores the blockchain as observed by every peer
  - GENESIS_BLOCK - the genesis block of the blockchain (0th block)
  - blocks_all - all blocks in blockahain : dict() from blkid to the block object
  - unadded_blocks - blocks received which cannot be added to the blockchain as of yet : set()
  - all_transactions - all transactions part of the blockcahin
  - txn_pool - transactions part of the longest chain in the blockchain
  - depth - the depth(or length) of the block in the blockchain
  - balances - balances of all peers as calculated at a block (based on transactions in the chain from that block to GENESIS_BLOCK)
  - longest_length - the length of the longest chain in blockchain (excluding GENESIS_BLOCK)
  - longest_block - the block at the end of the longest chain
  - peer - the peer class to which this blockchain belongs
  - blocks_in_longest_chain  - number of blocks created by this peer belonging to the longest chain
  - total_blocks_generated - total number of blocks generated by this peer in the blockchain

- Peer:
  - Class to represent the peers part of the network
  -
